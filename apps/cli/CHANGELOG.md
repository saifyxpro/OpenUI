## 0.0.1

### Initial Release

OpenUI CLI — select UI elements in your browser, describe changes, forward prompts to your IDE's AI agent.

- **Proxy Server**: Hosts the toolbar and the user's dev app on a single output port
- **Bridge Mode**: Connects the browser toolbar to IDE-based agents (Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Cline, Roo Code, Kilo Code, Trae, Antigravity)
- **Plugin System**: Auto-discovers and loads framework-specific plugins (React, Vue, Angular)
- **Command Wrapping**: Run `openui -- npm run dev` to consolidate your dev setup into one command
- **Clipboard Agent**: Built-in clipboard-based agent for quick copy/paste workflows
- **Telemetry**: Opt-in pseudonymized usage tracking with three privacy levels (off, anonymous, full)
