# @openui-plugins/angular

Angular framework plugin for the [OpenUI](https://github.com/saifyxpro/openui) toolbar.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @openui-plugins/angular
```

The CLI auto-discovers this plugin when it detects Angular in your project's dependencies.

## What It Does

When you select a DOM element in the toolbar, this plugin annotates it with the Angular component name and source file path, giving your IDE agent precise context about which component to modify.
